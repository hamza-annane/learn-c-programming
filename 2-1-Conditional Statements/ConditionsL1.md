# Exercises on Conditions in C

This repository contains a series of beginner-friendly C programming exercises focused on conditional logic. These challenges are designed to strengthen your understanding of `if`, `else`, `switch`, and other decision-making statements.

## ðŸš€ Challenges

### 1. Even or Odd
Write a program that asks for a number and displays whether the number is even or odd.

### 2. Vowel or Not
Write a C program that checks whether a character entered by the user is a vowel or not using the `switch` statement.

### 3. Sum of Two Values
Write a C program to calculate the sum of two given integers. If the two values are equal, return triple their sum.

### 4. Quadratic Equation
Write a C program that calculates the possible solutions of a quadratic equation (second degree).

### 5. Year Conversion
Write a menu-driven C program to convert a given year into:
- Months  
- Days  
- Hours  
- Minutes  
- Seconds  

*Note: Assume 1 year = 365 days, 1 month = 30 days. Ignore leap years for simplicity.*

### 6. Positive, Negative or Zero
Write a program to check whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero.

### 7. Uppercase Alphabet Check
Write a program to check whether a given character is an uppercase alphabet letter using `if-else`. Use ASCII values (`A` = 65 to `Z` = 90).

### 8. Grade Mention
Display the mention (grade level) obtained by a student based on their average:
- < 10 â†’ Failed  
- 10â€“11.99 â†’ Passable  
- 12â€“13.99 â†’ Fairly Good  
- 14â€“15.99 â†’ Good  
- â‰¥ 16 â†’ Very Good

### 9. Alphabet Check
Write a program that reads a character and determines if it is an alphabet letter. If yes, specify whether it's uppercase or lowercase.

### 10. Date Formatting
Write a program that reads a date in the format `15/09/2012` and displays it as `15-September-2012`.

### 11. Random Day of the Week
Write a program that randomly displays one of the seven days of the week.

### 12. Time Comparison
Write a program that reads two times in the format `HH:MM:SS` and prints:
- First time comes before second  
- Second time comes before first  
- Both times are equal

### 13. Point on a Segment
Write a program that reads the coordinates of a segment's two endpoints and a third point, then checks whether the point lies on the segment.
